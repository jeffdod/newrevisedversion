# The New Revised Version

## Project Goals
* Produce a continuous Greek text representing the Greek New Testament used by the Revised Version committee to create the (English) Revised Version New Testament of 1881.
* Generate a collation of this Greek text against the latest edition of the Robinson-Pierpont Byzantine Greek New Testament, showing all differences between the Greek text behind the Revised Version and the Byzantine text.
* Create a new English translation by modifying the Revised Version of 1881 to reflect how it would read if it had been translated from the Byzantine Greek New Testament.
* Modernize significant archaisms in this new translation.
