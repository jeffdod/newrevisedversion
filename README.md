# New Revised Version New Testament

Project Goals:
(1) Produce a continuous Greek text representing the Greek New Testament used by the Revised Version committee to create the (English) Revised Version New Testament of 1881.
(2) Produce an English New Testament which is identical to the Revised Version of 1881, but reflects how the text would read if translated from the Byzantine Textform as given in the latest Robinson-Pierpont Greek New Testament.
(3) Produce a newly revised English New Testament which updates archaisms found in the Revised Version of 1881.
