This project 
## Project Goals
- [x] Create draft Unicode and [Beta Code](http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/encoding/BCM.pdf) transcriptions of the main text of Edwin Palmer's *The Greek New Testament*.[^1]
- [ ] Proofread and correct the drafts; add morphological tags and Strong's numbers.
- [ ] Create an English New Testament that reflects how the Revised Version would read if the Revisers had translated from the Byzantine Greek text.
- [ ] Combine this English New Testament (the *Byzantine Revised Version*) with the RV Old Testament to make a complete digital Bible.
- [ ] Collate the Palmer Greek text against F.H.A. Scrivener's Textus Receptus, the Westcott-Hort New Testament, and the Robinson-Pierpont 2018 Byzantine Textform.
- [ ] Create a modernized English translation (the *New Revised Version*) of the *Byzantine Revised Version*.
