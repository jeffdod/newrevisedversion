# The New Revised Version

## Project Goals
* Create a digital edition of the Greek text used by the committee that produced the Revised Version New Testament of 1881.
* Show a collation of this digital edition against the Robinson-Pierpont Byzantine Greek New Testament.
* Produce an English New Testament translation that matches the Revised Version of 1881, but demonstrates how it would have read if translated from the Byzantine text.
* Combine this New Testament translation with the original Revised Version Old Testament to create a complete Bible.
