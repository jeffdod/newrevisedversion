# The ***New Revised Version*** Project

## Vision

The Revised Version of the English Bible (1885) and its American cousin, the American Standard Version (ASV) of 1901, have exerted significant influence on modern English Bible translation. Several modern English translations are based either directly or indirectly on the ASV, including the Revised Standard Version (RSV), the World English Bible (WEB), the New American Standard Bible (NASB), and the English Standard Version (ESV). The RV/ASV translations are still relevant today for the following reasons:

1. They are relevant due to their historical importance.
2. The RV/ASV remain (debatably) the most "accurate" translations in terms of maintaining a word-for-word correspondence with the Greek text.
3. Both translations are free of copyright, and readily available in Bible software packages.

The vision for this project is to 
## Project Goals
- [x] Create draft Unicode and [Beta Code](http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/encoding/BCM.pdf) transcriptions of the main text of Edwin Palmer's *The Greek New Testament*.[^1]
- [ ] Proofread and correct the drafts; add morphological tags and Strong's numbers.
- [ ] Create an English New Testament that reflects how the Revised Version would read if the Revisers had translated from the Byzantine Greek text.
- [ ] Combine this English New Testament (the *Byzantine Revised Version*) with the RV Old Testament to make a complete digital Bible.
- [ ] Collate the Palmer Greek text against F.H.A. Scrivener's Textus Receptus, the Westcott-Hort New Testament, and the Robinson-Pierpont 2018 Byzantine Textform.
- [ ] Create a modernized English translation (the *New Revised Version*) of the *Byzantine Revised Version*.
